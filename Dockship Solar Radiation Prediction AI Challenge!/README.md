## Welcome to Solar Radiation Prediction AI Challenge!
## The aim of this challenge is to predict the amount of solar radiation based on the given data. The dataset consists of 3 csv files:

TRAIN.csv
TEST.csv
sample_submission.csv
TRAIN.csv consists of 12 attributes:

idx
UNIXTime
Data
Time
Radiation (Target Attribute)
Temperature
Pressure
Humidity
WindDirection(Degrees)
Speed
TimeSunRise
TimeSunSet
This data should be used to train the model, no additional data is allowed to be used for the training process.
