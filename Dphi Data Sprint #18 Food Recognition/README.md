## Problem Overview
Deep learning has been proved to be an advanced technology for big data analysis with a large number of successful cases in image processing, speech recognition, object detection, and so on. It has also been introduced in food science and engineering. There are some research papers already published for the applications like food recognition, identification of healthier food, etc.
We have provided you with more than 5000 images of three different foods - burgers, pizzas and soft drinks.

## Objective
You are required to build a machine learning or deep learning model that would recognize if a given food is a pizza or a burger or a soft-drink.
